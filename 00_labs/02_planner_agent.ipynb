    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to create a sophisticated **Planner Agent** that can create structured plans for complex tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Coordination**: Built a planner agent that creates plans and hands them off to other agents for execution\n",
    "2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Implemented interactive tools that allow the agent to ask clarifying questions when faced with ambiguous requests\n",
    "3. **Nested Agent Architecture**: Created a planning tool that internally uses another specialized agent for outline generation\n",
    "4. **Structured Planning Output**: Used Pydantic models to ensure plans are returned in a consistent, well-defined format\n",
    "5. **Interactive Planning Process**: Demonstrated how agents can engage users to refine requirements before creating detailed plans\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Specialization**: Different agents can be designed for specific tasks (planning vs. execution)\n",
    "- **Interactive Decision Making**: Agents can pause execution to gather more information from users\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Agent Systems**: Agents can create and coordinate with other agents to accomplish complex tasks\n",
    "- **Structured Communication**: Pydantic models ensure reliable data exchange between agents and users\n",
    "- **Adaptive Planning**: The agent can adjust its planning approach based on user input and clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Planning Process Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assessment**: Agent evaluates the complexity and clarity of the user request\n",
    "2. **Clarification**: Uses human-in-the-loop tool to resolve ambiguities\n",
    "3. **Plan Generation**: Creates a detailed, structured outline using a specialized planning sub-agent\n",
    "4. **Structured Output**: Returns the plan in a well-defined format ready for execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This planner agent pattern is essential for building reliable AI systems that can handle complex, multi-step tasks while maintaining user control and transparency in the planning process.\n"
